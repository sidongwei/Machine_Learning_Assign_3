# Machine_Learning_Assign_3
The 3rd assignment.

My programs runs on python 3.6.5, and it will need numpy, csv packages.

Run the KLR.py file will generate 2 csv file named "result_lambda.csv" and "result_sigma.csv" respectively.
If you only want to run one of them, you can just annotate the other one in the main function(row 127,128).

Since the algorithm involves generating random permutations, the result may change each time.
